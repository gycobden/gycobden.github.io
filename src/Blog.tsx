One way to describe it is the four main types: administrative, observational, survey/response data, and experimental data, which have differing face validity, internal validity, and external validity, broadly and within each category.\n\n Big data is the recent explosion in the availability of data in every avenue.

More and more, reliance is placed upon data and people who can understand and inform decisions based on it.\n\nWhile data is powerful, decisions made based on data need to take into account several factors: the who, what, where, and why, and how of data collection. Data is not created equal â€“ in many cases, it is primarily taken from affluent communities that reflect the demographics of data collectors.\n\nThe who and where of data collection can cause underrepresentation and bias in major data sets.
